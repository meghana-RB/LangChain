    "Question Answering in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Retrieval (IR) is the task of answering questions through a combination of fetching the relevant documents and understanding them to make inferences, but abstaining when presented with a question that cannot be answered based on the provided context. __[LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/index.html)__ is a library that makes it easy to combine several language models for applications. This tutorial illustrates a robust QA application that uses embedding-based retrieval and answering with the LangChain library. \n"
